          <h2>Myth Busting</h2>
          <br>
          <p>Domestic abuse isn't just physical violence. Womens Aid defines domestic abuse as “….an incident or
            pattern
            of incidents of controlling, coercive, threatening, degrading and violent behaviour, including sexual
            violence, in the majority of cases by a partner or ex-partner, but also by a family member or carer.
            It is very common. In the vast majority of cases it is experienced by women and is perpetrated by men.”
            Women in abusive relationships need support and understanding – not judgement.

          <h2>more Myth busting</h2>
          <p>Just 10% of rapes are committed by strangers and according to Rape Crisis' research a woman is more
            likely to be abused by someone who claims to love them.
          </p>
          <p>Domestic abuse does not always include physical violence. Women’s Aid defines domestic abuse as an incident
            or pattern of incidents of controlling, coercive, threatening, degrading and violent behaviour, including
            sexual violence, by a partner or ex-partner. These incidents can include coercive control; psychological
            and/or emotional abuse; physical abuse; sexual abuse; financial abuse; harassment; stalking; and/or online
            or digital abuse.

          <h2>The Freedom Programme </h2>
          <p>Freedom Programme is a domestic violence programme which was created by Pat Craven who holds the
            copyright
            (all rights reserved) and evolved from her work with perpetrators of domestic violence. We provide
            information, not therapy.
            The Programme was primarily designed for women as victims of domestic violence, since research shows
            that in
            the vast majority of cases of serious abuse are male on female.
            The programme, when provided as an intensive two day course, is also suitable for men, whether abusive
            and
            wishing to change their attitudes and behaviour or whether victims of same sex domestic abuse
            themselves.

            The Freedom Programme examines the roles played by attitudes and beliefs on the actions of abusive men
            and
            the responses of victims and survivors. The aim is to help them to make sense of and understand what
            has
            happened to them, instead of the whole experience just feeling like a horrible mess. The Freedom
            Programme
            also describes in detail how children are affected by being exposed to this kind of abuse and very
            importantly how their lives are improved when the abuse is removed.
